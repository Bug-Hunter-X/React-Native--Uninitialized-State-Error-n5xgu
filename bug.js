This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or prop before it has been fully initialized. This often happens when the component renders before the asynchronous operation that sets the state or prop has completed.  For example:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  state = {
    data: null,
  };

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('some-api-endpoint')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.data.someProperty}</Text>  {/* Error here if data is null */}
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, `this.state.data` might be null when the component initially renders because `componentDidMount` hasn't finished fetching the data yet.  Accessing `this.state.data.someProperty` would throw an error.
