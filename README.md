# React Native Uninitialized State Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: attempting to access a state variable or prop before it has been initialized.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

Accessing state or props before an asynchronous operation that sets their values has completed can lead to runtime errors, typically `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'someProperty')`.  This is because the component renders before the data is available.

## Solution

The solution involves using conditional rendering to check if the data is available before attempting to access it.  This prevents the error and enhances app stability.
